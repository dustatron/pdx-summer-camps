    "description": "At PIVOT PDX Summer Camps, kids will explore performing as an outlet for creativity, artistry, humor, and expression. We teach, model, and normalize using our bodies for expression and the stage for sharing.\n\nThe tenets of camp curriculum are: 1) the power and gift of music, 2) our natural response to move our bodies when we hear/feel rhythm and beat, and 3) performance as a means of sharing and being seen.\n\nStudents will engage in a myriad of activities that will introduce them to the stage. Activities such as charades, musical dots, find the beat, pass the move, sketch comedy, hand puppets, and karaoke will be explored. With all of the fun and excitement, students don't realize they are performing, but each time they present in front of their peers, they are growing in their confidence!\n\nPIVOT PDX Camps are held at the Historic Alberta House in the Alberta Arts District of NE Portland. All camps are directed by Lauren Kawa Funk and a team of junior coach interns (camp alumni who are now in high school) who grow in their leadership and creative skills as they guide and support campers throughout the week. We will honor each camper’s individual journey and the unique talents they are comfortable sharing.\n\nSix week-long camps will run in Summer 2023 for kids rising into grades 1st-8th in fall 2023. Camps run Mon-Friday from 8:30am-1pm with an aftercare option until 4:30pm. No experience necessary though a general appreciation for movement and music is appreciated.\n\nMutual aid/no pay spots are available in each camp. Mutual aid is solidarity-based support for marginalized communities. Email hello@thisispivotpdx.com for a Mutual Aid spot.",

With inclusivity and diversity in mind, we created a camp that offers a spectrum of fun and creative learning opportunities for the NEXT GENERATION! Children are creative by nature, so we intend to harness that creativity and direct it back into each student by way of the arts. By incorporating games within every lesson children feel safe and stimulated while being exposed to a variety of rich and colorful art forms! We will introduce “campers” to song and dance, theater arts, and visual arts in efforts to cater to a range of learning styles and interests. Each week will culminate in a warm, yet casual showcase where campers will be celebrated and awarded for their participation and overall contribution to the program. Each camper that completes a week of camp will receive a badge of honor!\n\nClass descriptions:\n\nVisual arts will include arts and craft style lessons. All materials will be provided.\n\nSong and dance will include freestyle dance, exposure to choreography, and learning lyrics and rhythms.\n\nTheater arts will include cartoon studies, character development, and musical theater exposure.\n\nAge groups and expectations:\n\nCampers 5-7 will primarily focus on developing motor skills, expanding their ability to coordinate, exercise attention and retention, and most importantly, increase focus.\n\nCampers 8-11 will be exposed to working in groups/teams, creating and developing their ideas, confidence building, learning new vocabulary, and articulating thoughts into words and other artistic expressions.\n\nCampers 12-15 will be challenged to use their creativity while critically thinking. They will learn communication and goal setting skills that apply to art making. And finally, these campers will learn how to present their own work of art from start to finish!\n\nSummer Camps - Next Gen (vmacnextgen.com)",

    "description": "Enjoy the sunshine and water this summer and let ORU introduce you to the wonderful world of rowing! Two-week camp sessions are available from July through August. This camp is designed to give students with no prior rowing experience an opportunity to determine if rowing is a good fit and to prepare them to join ORU’s Junior Rowing Team (with the Coach’s approval) in the Fall.\n\nSafety is our number one priority. Due to the unique demands of the sport of rowing and ORU’s summer coaching and program structure, prospective students must possess general fitness and meet the following prerequisites in order to participate in the camp:\n\n* Be at least 13 years old;\n\n* Weigh no more than 190 lbs (This is the maximum weight-limit of the current ORU rowing shell inventory);\n\n* Stand at least 5'3\" tall and be able to lift 25 lbs overhead (The participants of each rowing shell will work together to lift their boat into and out of the water and will carry it on their shoulders to and from the dock);\n\n* Be able to get in and out of the rowing shells under their own power.\n\n* Arrange and successfully complete a Swim and Float Test (or provide recognized documentation of swimming ability, such as a Red Cross Water Safety Card or Lifeguard Certification). This requirement must be satisfied prior to the first day of the LTR camp session.\n\n* ORU is not currently equipped to offer Adaptive Rowing.\n\nAll LTR sessions are held at the Oaks Park Community Boathouse. Classes are held on M-W-F, from 8:00-10:30 AM, with the exception of Session #1 (See notification below). The cost to attend is $175/session.\n\nSession #1: Jul 3-14, 2023\n\nSession #2: Jul 17-28, 2023\n\nSession #3: Jul 31-Aug 11, 2023\n\nSession #4: Aug 14-25, 2023\n\nAll sessions are held at the Oaks Park Community Boathouse. Students will begin their session by learning water and boat safety, rowing terminology, the parts of the boat, and how to carry the boat to and from the dock. They will also learn the mechanics of the rowing stroke, including proper rowing form and sequence. Instruction begins first on land through the use of ergometers (indoor rowing machines), and then moves to the water (Willamette River), where students will learn how to safely get in and out of a shell, how to properly hold their oars, and the basic techniques of sculling. Along with gaining fitness and strength, students will enjoy team camaraderie!",

Due to the unique demands of the sport of rowing and ORU’s summer coaching and program structure, prospective students must possess general fitness and meet the following prerequisites in order to participate in the camp:\n\n* Be at least 13 years old;\n\n* Weigh no more than 190 lbs (This is the maximum weight-limit of the current ORU rowing shell inventory);\n\n* Stand at least 5'3\" tall and be able to lift 25 lbs overhead (The participants of each rowing shell will work together to lift their boat into and out of the water and will carry it on their shoulders to and from the dock);\n\n* Be able to get in and out of the rowing shells under their own power.\n\n* Arrange and successfully complete a Swim and Float Test (or provide recognized documentation of swimming ability, such as a Red Cross Water Safety Card or Lifeguard Certification). This requirement must be satisfied prior to the first day of the LTR camp session.\n\n* ORU is not currently equipped to offer Adaptive Rowing.\n\nAll LTR sessions are held at the Oaks Park Community Boathouse. Classes are held on M-W-F, from 8:00-10:30 AM, with the exception of Session #1 (See notification below). The cost to attend is $175/session.\n\nSession #1: Jul 3-14, 2023\n\nSession #2: Jul 17-28, 2023\n\nSession #3: Jul 31-Aug 11, 2023\n\nSession #4: Aug 14-25, 2023\n\nAll sessions are held at the Oaks Park Community Boathouse. Students will begin their session by learning water and boat safety, rowing terminology, the parts of the boat, and how to carry the boat to and from the dock. They will also learn the mechanics of the rowing stroke, including proper rowing form and sequence. Instruction begins first on land through the use of ergometers (indoor rowing machines), and then moves to the water (Willamette River), where students will learn how to safely get in and out of a shell, how to properly hold their oars, and the basic techniques of sculling. Along with gaining fitness and strength, students will enjoy team camaraderie!",

Each day at camp is a new adventure as we explore and learn on our site at Topaz Farm.  The day starts with an opening circle where we might do some Sauvie Island Center yoga while listening for the call of the Red-winged blackbird.  Much of our day includes time in the Grow Lunch Garden, campers very own farm row. Together we learn about the land, care for the soil, and plant and taste all kinds of vegetables.  We may even learn about new friends like the Pacific Treefrogs who often nestle in rows colorful rainbow chard. And what camp would be complete without  traditional activities like games, camp songs, arts and crafts. Each day we focus on different parts of the Sauvie Island Center curriculum including:\n\nSoil Exploration: Dig in and learn about healthy soil.\nSeed to Harvest: Plant, tend and harvest the Grow Lunch Garden.\nPlant Parts Investigation: Explore the farm and plants we can eat.\nWildlife & Food Web: Who else has been foraging on the farm?\nPollination Station: Meet these hard-working farm friends.\n\nAt the Sauvie Island Center we recognize we are growing and learning on unceded lands of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde, who represent a portion of the original inhabitants of this land. The island known as Sauvie Island was home to a band of the Multnomah People of the Chinook Nation.",

Hands-on craft projects and science experiments foster a deeper connection with the material. Ballet Classes are offered during the school year in 3 levels, each of which is taught in either English or beginning French. The Toddler class allows for a parent/guardian to participate with their little dancer. Miss Ella’s teaching approach is to encourage imagination and fun. She is dedicated to bringing the magic of dance to children and inspiring them for the future. Ballerina Party Entertainer is a perfect way to get kids dancing, being creative and having fun together. Miss Ella has wonderful themes and imaginative storylines that kids help create and bring to life as a group. At the end there is a chance for every participant to do a small solo and receive a prize.",

Ballet Classes are offered during the school year in 3 levels, each of which is taught in either English or beginning French. The Toddler class allows for a parent/guardian to participate with their little dancer. Miss Ella’s teaching approach is to encourage imagination and fun. She is dedicated to bringing the magic of dance to children and inspiring them for the future. Ballerina Party Entertainer is a perfect way to get kids dancing, being creative and having fun together. Miss Ella has wonderful themes and imaginative storylines that kids help create and bring to life as a group.

    "description": "In the Write Now Portland Summer Camps, we teach creative writing and play games outdoors at Mt. Tabor Park in SE Portland. Each camp is limited to 10-12 students. In this small group setting, students learn what makes writing strong, the three pillars of every story, and how to use the 5 senses to bring their writing alive. They will have quiet time to write, to share and give compliments, and to play. Students of all writing levels are welcome. This camp is most effective for students who have some motivation to write and can work independently with guidance. By the end of the week, students will have special spots in the park that they feel connected to, will have a story started and developed, and will have become better writers; all while having fun. This camp is open ended and can be repeated throughout the summer. Students can bring projects they are already working on or begin something new. We help students get ideas, too.\n\nOne of our favorite quotes about this camp came from a 4th grade boy who said last summer, \"I woke up with a smile on my face every day just knowing that I got to come to this camp.\"\nYour child will develop writing skills, play a variety of games in nature, and expand their creativity.\nFor ages 8-12 years old. All camps are half-day, 9 am-12 pm.\nThe schedule can be found at http://www.writenowportland.com/summer-camps.html",

    "description": "DANCE CLASSES + SUMMER WORKSHOPS + BIRTHDAY PARTIES for ages 2-8 IMA Summer Workshops offer an introduction to a variety of dance styles as well as cultural context of where the movement styles come from. Some of the workshops for older children combine dance and science around themes of water, wind and light. Hands-on craft projects and science experiments foster a deeper connection with the material. Ballet Classes are offered during the school year in 3 levels, each of which is taught in either English or beginning French. The Toddler class allows for a parent/guardian to participate with their little dancer. Miss Ella’s teaching approach is to encourage imagination and fun. She is dedicated to bringing the magic of dance to children and inspiring them for the future. Ballerina Party Entertainer is a perfect way to get kids dancing, being creative and having fun together. Miss Ella has wonderful themes and imaginative storylines that kids help create and bring to life as a group. At the end there is a chance for every participant to do a small solo and receive a prize.",
