    "description": "Lovegood Performing Arts Company opened its doors for in-person and virtual classes in February of 2021, serving students ages 8-22 with dance, voice, acting, and technical theater education and performance opportunities. \n\nFor students 10 to 22 years of age, Lovegood provides an opportunity to dive deep into four main focus areas: dance, voice, acting, and technical theater.  Many students take more than one focus area during a season, allowing them to engage in multiple areas of interest simultaneously.  The intention with classes based on focus areas is to allow for deep instruction and progression within the area or areas students want to explore most.\n\nFor 8 and 9 year old students Lovegood offers a weekly musical theater combination class that introduces their youngest students to dance, voice, and acting all in one class session.\n\nLovegood is unique in their approach to involving students in all aspects of the performing arts experience. In addition to on-stage performance opportunities youth participants in the technical theater program are working with adult instructors to learn the art of technical theater. They are working to build an all new black box studio, which is giving them hands-on experience with how a theater is put together. Lovegood is the only youth performing arts company in Beaverton with a professional black box studio venue as part of their educational space; which provides a unique opportunity for students to perform in the same place they attend classes and rehearse.",

Students experience a 3-hour class once a week during the school year or over five consecutive days during Summer, Winter, & Spring breaks. In each class, students learn how to make healthy, delicious and seasonal meals from scratch to consumption — all while experimenting with math and science concepts, working on their reading skills, and polishing up their table manners by sharing meals around the LKA community table (made with more than 33,000 recycled chopsticks).\n\nAs warm summer days give way to the crisp, fresh air of Fall and the leaves change from green to gold, we know that the harvest season has begun. In Fall, Mother Nature provides us with delicious fresh vegetables like squash, pumpkins, corn, and carrots. This bounty of fresh, colorful vegetables inspires our students to try new foods that they never knew they liked!\n\nOur Fall Season is a time of delight and exploration as our students try new recipes filled with fresh, local, seasonal vegetables. The weather may begin to get colder, but inside Little Kitchen Academy every day is full of warmth and joy as your child learns practical life skills that will last a lifetime.",

Kids camp has given kids ages 6 1/2-12 a chance to be immersed in visual arts, music, theater, and dance Monday through Friday. This is 360 Arts Education!\n\nAll campers must follow instructions, participate, collaborate with others, read and write, and be respectful self-managers. The overall lesson plans and daily goals for creation for both age groups are similar, with age-appropriate challenge-level to keep the artistic spark alive.\n\nCampers ages 6 1/2 to 9\nLesson plans for younger campers focus on encouraging natural creativity, fearlessness, and gifts. Younger campers are often paired with Intern helpers who can help to ignite confidence and assist with reading or writing. However, our ability to provide \"hands-on\" assistance is limited.\n\nCampers ages 10 to 12\nLesson plans for older campers allow for the opportunity to explore and collaborate with peers. Older campers create more complex artistic projects, try new things, and showcase their unique talents and gifts.\n\n​Friday Artists\nOn Friday of each camp, we work with artists from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds to perform and workshop with our campers.\nPrevious Friday Artists include Journey Brazil, En Taiko, Natya Leela Academy, Inka Jam, and Grupo Condor.\nThe incredible 2022 Friday Artists Are\nLatin Groove PDX Productions\nMic Crenshaw Performs Social Justice Hip Hop​\n\nThe Venues\nWeek 1 - Newmark Theatre, 1111 SW Broadway\nWe're returning to our home for the first week of 360 Arts Camp in 2022. We will be utilizing the Winningstad & Brunish Theatres. as well as lobby space. It's a very cool location.\n\nWeeks 2 & 3 - World Forestry Center Central Plaza & Cheatham Hall\n4033 SW Canyon Road, Portland, OR 97221. It's an immersive and vibrant distinctly Oregon location nestled in the trees.\nWe selected the World Forestry Center because of its convenient location off Highway 26, across the zoo's parking lot, and a few steps from the Max station. We strongly encourage taking public transportation.\n\n360 Arts Camp will be located at the tented outdoor Central Plaza to the left of the Discovery Center and in Cheatham Hall, which offers ample space for socially distancing and creation. Campers will be indoors and outdoors throughout the day and provided with outdoor mask breaks. Campers will be in age-based pods. We may also take field trips to explore the Japanese Garden, Children's Museum, zoo, and surrounding trails.\n\nAccess to the Arts - Scholarships Available!\nWe believe in the vital importance of arts education in self-confidence, wellbeing, and social inclusion. Therefore, we offer scholarships for children to attend 360 Arts Camp. Scholarships, generally 20-90%, are needs-based and awarded on camper loads and will be reviewed and awarded monthly until we reach capacity.\n\n​What happens at 360 Arts Camp?\nCampers arrive between 8:50 a.m. and 9 a.m., participate in fun warm-up exercises, and receive the schedule for the day. Monday through Thursday, campers create art in two disciplines (visual arts and music, for instance) in the morning and two in the afternoon (theater and dance, for example). The order of the disciplines alternates each day.\nOn Fridays, campers utilize the skills and creations throughout the week to create a group performance, incorporating lessons learned from our multicultural guest artists. Therefore, attendance each day is important.\nCamp ends at 3:58 p.m. with a prompt pickup at 4 p.m.\n\n​The Faculty\nEach of our faculty members is a trained artist and educator in their respective visual arts, music, theater, and dance disciplines. Many will be returning to our camp, having been a part of it for years.\n\n​The Counselors (formerly known as Interns!) - Kids Ages 13-18\nWe have opportunities for older kids who would like to participate and earn valuable volunteer experience. These incredible teenagers, who proudly wear green t-shirts, are usually former campers. They have the opportunity to supervise, create art, and work directly to inspire younger kids.",

    "description": "In a Child’s Path Farm Preschool, located on an eight-acre farm in Clackamas County just 10 minutes east of Gresham, is a child-centered program promoting all facets of development in children ages 2 to 5 years. Children learn how to care for animals, plant gardens, cook and enjoy music time. Please call Cindy at 503.912.0035 or email to schedule a tour. We also offer week-long summer camps for children 3-6 years old. Please visit our summer camps webpage for more information.\n\nWe are now offering summer camps to children aged 3 to 6 this summer with a main focus on the farm and a variety of minor focuses each week. The camps are structured in a way that the learning ties together. For example, if a child attends camp for three consecutive weeks, the learning will not seem staggered; it will flow respectfully in a way that a child will learn best. On the other hand, if a child attends only one week or a week each month their learning will flow nicely as well. We will meet at camp starting each new week with a song that is relevant to our subject of learning along with open-ended activities at different stations. The yard that the campers work in when they arrive each morning is comprised of six flower beds, a jungle gym, a large sandbox, a playhouse, a rock wall, and tons of room to run! After breakfast, we could be found anywhere on the eight acres.",

    "description": "Fun! That’s what is waiting for campers of all ages this year at Camp Wa-Ri-Ki!\n\nKiwanis Camp Wa-Ri-Ki, located in Washougal, Skamania County, Washington is 18+ acres of beautiful land in the heart of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. It is our mission to provide an outdoor experience that offers optimal development of at-risk youth and our communities through recreational, educational and leadership opportunities. We offer programs in four categories: Nature-based Learning; Leadership and Personal Development; Fun, Exploration and Adventure and Outdoor Skills. Many camp activities integrate with local school’s STEM and STEAM curriculum.\n\nNASA’s GLOBE Goes to Camp\n\nOur programs are available by age group to allow peer-learning, appropriate outcome measures and to ensure safety of participants. We are the ONLY camp in Washington State that is a certified partner with NASA’s GLOBE Goes to Camp pilot program. GLOBE: Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment provides exciting learning opportunities through hands-on experiences.\n\nStation Master Training\n\nDesigned for campers 15 year and up – including adults – this training program offers a unique opportunity to learn and lead. Campers learn the basics of the GLOBE program while becoming a “master” at leading activities in four core areas: Atmosphere; Biosphere; Hydrosphere and Pedosphere (Soil). This training is FREE and is offered through a virtual platform.\n\nLadybug Garden\n\nOur Ladybug Garden program offers a variety of connections to the garden. From gardening basics for elementary campers to upper grade level campers that utilize the garden in their GLOBE experiments.\n\nNature Days\n\nOne of our most popular programs, Nature Days is designed for our youngest campers to explore the living world around them. From leaf’s to bugs, from water to sky, campers have a great time playing games, running through the meadow to discover new and exciting elements of nature.\n\nVolunteer Opportunities – Camp Counselor\n\nIn addition to our Station Master program, we offer volunteer opportunities to youth (15+) and adults to assist with activities during each camp session. Camp Counselors lead activities, monitor play to ensure safety and guide campers from one activity to another.\n\nInternship Opportunities\n\nFor campers 15+ that want to spend more time at camp, we have a number of opportunities available to help explore career interests, expand skills, and develop work experiences. We work with each individual camper to design a program that meets their needs and career/work goals.\n\nMore Information\n\nMore program details, registration and date information can be found on our website at www.campwariki.com. You can also read our “Safety First” COVID-19 plan to keep everyone safe while at camp.",

Family Camps will provide day-camp style activities during the day for kids, with shared family meals and plenty of time together as well. ",

Children ages 8-12 will develop their own stories, play games and build a sense of community in these half-day outdoors writing camps. We focus on activating the five senses both in the writing and in the games we play, ensuring an exciting and experiential week for all.\n \nOne of our favorite quotes about this camp came from a 4th grade boy who said last summer, \"I woke up with a smile on my face every day just knowing that I got to come to this camp.\"\n \nYour child will develop writing skills, get exercise and have a great time expanding their creativity.\n \nOften children want to do the camp multiple times, to keep working on their story and to enjoy time out in nature. This camp is open ended and can be repeated.\n \nThe schedule can be found here:  http://www.writenowportland.com/summer-camps.html",

They will focus on our farm animals like our goats, alpacas, and birds, we'll be going into the garden and taking lots of nature walks. Camps will include nature crafts, learning about farming, and where our food comes from.\n\nCome experience farm life by reserving a guided educational farm tour that takes you up close and personal with our lovely farm animals. Our working farm raises animals for eggs, milk, fiber, and meat. We have alpacas, goats, ostriches, peacocks, and more. You'll even get a chance to feed some! Adults can make it a Tipsy Tour! We offer beer and wine from local vineyards and breweries to take with you on the tour.  See our website to book a tour. https://triskeleefarm.com/farm-experiences\n\nWe are here to share our farm with you and teach you where our food comes from. Because food doesn't come from the store, it comes from a farmer! Triskelee Farm began as a mere wish and then it came to fruition in 2018. The name Triskelee is derived from the ancient Celtic symbol Triskele meaning things of three. Such as past, present, and future. For us, it represents the three generations of our family that all came together to learn how to farm and live together. We had no farming experience when we started this journey we just knew we wanted our children to be close to their extended family and have an outdoor environment to grow up in.\n\nCheck out our new Triskelee Sprouts Farm School at triskeleesprouts.com ",
